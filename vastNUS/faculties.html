              <h2><a href="https://law.nus.edu.sg/">NUS Faculty of Law</a></h2>
              <p>The National University of Singapore Faculty of Law is widely regarded as Asia’s leading law school. Staffed by an outstanding permanent faculty diverse in origin and qualifications, NUS Law is dedicated to building a vibrant community and creating an environment that facilitates critical thinking and reflection on the fundamental legal issues confronting our interconnected world.
                <br>
                <br>
                Located in Singapore, which for more than a century has been a commercial hub at the crossroads of Asia, NUS Law is very much Asia’s Global Law School. Since 1957 our curriculum has been infused with perspectives from other jurisdictions and disciplines. This tradition has accelerated in recent years, providing a legal education that is comparative, international, and multi-disciplinary. The Law School hosts many visiting faculty and students from every continent, offering a lively, cosmopolitan atmosphere both inside and outside the classroom.
                <br>
                <br>
                The strength of the NUS Law curriculum lies in the broad and diverse range of subjects it offers. In addition to a rigorous core curriculum, students can choose electives in areas ranging from Asian legal studies to banking and finance, from public international law to intellectual property, or from arbitration to jurisprudence. The aim is to provide a liberal education that enables our graduates to think critically and creatively, as globally-oriented lawyers with a strong sense of their role in society.
                <br>
                <br>
                Global, regional, and uniquely Singaporean perspectives on legal issues are all evident in the research produced by our faculty. The professors at NUS Law are not only engaged in a constant search for better legal solutions to the issues that confront all societies, but are also continually challenging accepted wisdom and conventional norms by raising new questions and problems to be confronted. Their work stretches across all aspects of law and appears in the most prestigious journals as well as books published by leading university presses around the world.

              <p>The time for Asia is now. For years, the world’s economic centre has been pulling away from the West. While some might argue who will take America’s place as the engine of the world economy, the facts are clear and undisputed. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Asia is and will continue to be the world’s fastest-growing region, with China and India leading the charge. By 2050, these two countries will become the world’s largest economies. The world’s economic centre will be in Asia. A new world order is taking shape, definitely economically but potentially politically as well.

                In this re-assignment of global leadership, the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP), part of the National University of Singapore, will continue to inspire, improve lives, and take central position in the conversation to transform Asia. We do this by working hard on two planks: pursuing academic and intellectual excellence, and crafting lessons for meaningful public policy-making.</p>
